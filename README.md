# Smart_watchesSTM32
My pet project of smart watches on STM32F103T8U6 MCU.

# Project state
Currently it's under development
# Hardware list
- Mini node V2 with STM32 F103T8U6 MCU
- OLED display ssd1306
- MAX30102 sensor

# Driver for display

# Driver for sensor
https://github.com/eepj/stm32-max30102/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file

# Features implented
- Added new font with russian text
- Implemented recognition of touch on sensor of MAX30102

# Features under development
- Algorithm to count hearth rate and SpO2
- Proper display of hearth rate and SpO2 on display

# Future plans
- Adding Bluetooth antenna to connect to smartphone
- Passing information about "device" to smartphone
